## VE 477 Introduction to Algorithms

### Reading Order

8 homework can be found in ```./Homework```, where I did maths proofs, algorithm design, and critical thinking. 

8 labs can be found in ```./Lab```, where I implement well-known algorithms like `Union-Find data structure`, `Kruskal’s algorithm`, `Prim’s algorithm for solving the Minimum Spanning Tree problem`, `Gale-Shapley algorithm`, `Fibonacci Heap data structure`, `Dijkstra algorithm using Fibonacci heaps`, `Bellman-Ford`, `Edmonds-Karp algorithm`  (mainly in Python and few in C).

Challenge question can be found in ```./Challenge```, which is a very difficult interview algorithm question. I use sorting algorithm to reduce the time complexity of merge intervals down to $\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$. Further improvement on time complexity can be achieved probably through advanced data structure like **Segment Tree**.

3 projects can be found in ```./Projects```, where I did some research on interesting topic together with my teammates ```Xuting Yang``` and ```Jiachen Lu```. 

20Fall semester special: A bonus is given to students who write labs using `OCaml`.

#### Course Syllabus

This course has been tailored with three main goals in mind:

• Become familiar with the most common problems and algorithm paradigms • Understand how to properly analyse and abstract a problem• Be able to identify or design clear and efficient algorithms to solve a problem

Hence, at the end of this course, students should be provided with a solid basis for any further study in the field of algorithmic; In particular they should have developed the necessary skills to decide on the validity and efficiency of some given solution to a problem.

These goals are fulfilled through the following course outcomes:

• Be able to write clean and clear pseudocode (chap. 1)

• Be proficient at using all the basic algorithm paradigms (chap. 1,3,4,5,6,7)

• Be able to assess the difficulty of a given problem, e.g belongs to P, NP, PSPACE...(chap. 2) • Develop critical thinking abilities (chap. 1)

• Know when and how to apply dynamic programming (chap. 3)

• Have a precise idea of the pros and cons for the most common data structures (chap. 1)

• Know how to efficiently solve the most common mathematical problems (chap. 7)

• Be able to efficiently implement the most common algorithms (mainly labs)
