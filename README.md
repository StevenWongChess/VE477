## VE 477 Introduction to Algorithms

### Reading Order

8 homework can be found in ```./Homework```, where I did maths proofs, algorithm design, and critical thinking. 

8 labs can be found in ```./Lab```, where I did coding exercises (mainly in Python and few in C).

Challenge question can be found in ```./Challenge```, which is a very difficult interview algorithm question. Further improvement on time complexity can be achieved probably through advanced data structure like **Segment Tree**.

3 projects can be found in ```./Projects```, where I did some research on interesting topic together with my teammates ```Xuting Yang``` and ```Jiachen Lu```. 

20Fall semester special: A bonus is given to students who write labs using OCaml.
